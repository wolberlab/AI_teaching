A mixture of nM GST-PPARG-LBD, 5 nM Tb-GST-antibody, 5 nM Fluormone Pan-PPAR Green, and serial dilutions of the experimental compound, beginning at 10 μM downwards, was added to wells of black 384-well low-volume plates (Greiner) to a total volume of 18 μL. All dilutions were made in TR-FRET assay buffer C. DMSO at 2% final concentration was used as a no-ligand control. Experiment was performed in triplicate, and incubated for 2 hours in the dark prior to assay read in Perkin Elmer ViewLux ultra HTS microplate reader. FRET signal was measured by excitation at 340 nm and emission at 520 nm for fluorescein and 490 nm for terbium. Fold change over DMSO was calculated using GraphPad Prism Software (La Jolla, Calif.) by calculating 520 nm/490 nm ratio.
