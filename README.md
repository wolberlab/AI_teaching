## 🧠 Course Overview

This 1-1.5 day(s) practical course introduces fundamental concepts of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) applied to **in silico virtual screening (VS)** for drug discovery.

Students will gain hands-on experience using **Jupyter Notebooks** on **JupyterHub** with a complete ML pipeline (from data → model → screening). By the end, students will:

- Understand basic ML models and their applications in pharmacy.
- Handle real compound data using Python and Pandas.
- Generate and interpret molecular descriptors (e.g., ECFP).
- Train and evaluate ML models for drug screening.
- Screen compound libraries and identify potential leads.
